# Expo Android Intermittent Crash: A Case Study

This repository documents a strange issue encountered while developing an Expo managed workflow application for Android. The application worked flawlessly on iOS and within the Expo Go client on Android, yet it would intermittently crash on physical Android devices.  Crash logs provided minimal information, only indicating a generic 'native module' error.  This made debugging exceptionally challenging.

The solution involved a careful review of native module dependencies and build processes.  The specifics are detailed below.

## Bug Reproduction (bug.js)

```javascript
// Simplified example; actual codebase was more complex
import * as React from 'react';
import { View, Text } from 'react-native';
import { useAsyncStorage } from 'expo-secure-store';
// ... other imports

const App = () => {
  const [value, setValue] = useAsyncStorage('myKey');

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>App Content</Text>
    </View>
  );
};

export default App;
```

## Solution (bugSolution.js)

The issue was eventually traced to an incompatibility between the Expo SDK version and a specific native module dependency.  The solution implemented here is generalized, and the actual solution in your case may vary. The steps below were undertaken for a better and more stable implementation.

1. **Verify Dependencies:** Check all native modules used in your project and ensure they're compatible with your current Expo SDK version. Use `expo diagnostics` to check your expo and native module versions and compatibility.
2. **Update Expo SDK:** Upgrade to the latest stable Expo SDK version. Run `expo upgrade`. 
3. **Clean Build:**  Do a clean build of your project. This can sometimes resolve issues related to cached build artifacts. For example, run `expo prebuild` and then `expo run:android`. 
4. **Rebuild Native Modules:** The project's native modules might have become corrupted. You could try cleaning the project's build directory, then rebuilding the native modules from scratch. Refer to the documentation on how to clean the project's build directory and rebuild native modules for your specific build system.
5. **Check for Conflicts:** Review your `package.json` and `app.json` for any potential dependency conflicts that could be causing problems.

```javascript
//This file will show the solution. It's recommended to upgrade Expo SDK and verify dependencies before implementation
import * as React from 'react';
import { View, Text } from 'react-native';
import { useAsyncStorage } from 'expo-secure-store';
// ... other imports

const App = () => {
  const [value, setValue] = useAsyncStorage('myKey');

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>App Content</Text>
    </View>
  );
};

export default App;
```
