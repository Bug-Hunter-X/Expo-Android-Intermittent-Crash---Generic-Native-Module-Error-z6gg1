While developing an Expo managed workflow application, I encountered an unusual issue where the application would crash intermittently on Android devices.  The crash reports didn't provide much detail, mentioning only a generic 'native module' error. The application functioned perfectly on iOS and in the Expo Go app on Android. The error was inconsistent and difficult to reproduce reliably.
